## 2. Principle

The protection of your data is important.
This app:

- **does not collect any personal data**
- does **not automatically transmit data to servers**
- does **not use an internet connection**

## 3. How the app works

The app passively scans Bluetooth signals in the vicinity.

Only the following information is collected and displayed within the app:

- Time of the scan
- Signal strength (RSSI)
- Device name sent (if available)
- Manufacturer code sent
This is publicly available information from the BLE ADV frame and does not make you identifiable at all.

**Important:**

- **No active Bluetooth connection** is established with other devices. 
- **No communication with other devices** takes place. 
- Devices are detected passively only. 

## 4. Data collected
### 4.1 Legal basis

If, in exceptional cases, the Bluetooth signals recorded are deemed to be personally identifiable, as in sum of all signals received, a third party could conduct  profiling, the processing is carried out on the basis of:

- Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract – provision of the app function)
or
- Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in the technical functionality of the app)

As no personal data is processed, no legal basis is required.

### 4.2 Technical scan data
The app only processes technical signal information from Bluetooth devices within Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) range.

This information:

- is only processed locally on the user's device
 
## 5. Data transfer

- Scanned manufacturer code

**No information about the user's own smartphone or the user as a person or entity** is transmitted.

The transfer takes place exclusively via the app selected by the user (e.g. email or messenger).

## 6. Internet usage

The app does **not have any function for communication via the Internet**.
**No data** is transferred to external servers.

## 7. Bluetooth permissions

The app requires Bluetooth permissions to scan devices in the vicinity.

These permissions are used exclusively for:

- passive detection of Bluetooth signals
- display of technical signal data within the app

There will be:

- **no active connection** established
- **no pairing** performed
- **no data sent** to other devices

## 8. Data security

As no data is transferred to external servers, there is no risk of server-side storage.
All processed information remains stored locally on the user's device and is subject to the security mechanisms of the Android operating system.

## 9. Data storage and deletion

All information stored within the app remains locally on the device.
When the app is uninstalled, all stored data is automatically deleted. Furthremore, the app contains a **delete function** which removes currently stored data imediately from the app.


## 10. User rights
