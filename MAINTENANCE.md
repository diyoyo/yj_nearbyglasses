This app's code will get some more tweaks an updates as my resources allow me to.
I am not super confident for how long this will be and to what extent. Right now, it's just a hobby project in hope someone would find it useful. I am open to issues and bug reports, suggestions and ideas fir improving the *Nearby Glasses* app, but I can't guarantee to implement anything of it sooner or later.
Hebce, it is advisable to take this code as experimental, with no liability and guarantees attached to it.
